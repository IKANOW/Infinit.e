		Defines the appearance of the the List's drop indicator.
		To customize the drop indicator appearance, create a custom ListSkin class.
		The List's layout takes care to size and position the dropIndicator.
		The size of the <code>dropIndicator</code> is typically set to the size of the gaps between the items.
		The minimum and maximum settings are typically respected only in the direction
		along the major axis (the gap axis).  For example a VerticalLayout ignores the
		<code>minWidth</code> and <code>maxWidth</code> settings,
		but respect <code>minHeight</code> and <code>maxHeight</code>.

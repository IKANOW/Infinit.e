# /etc/cron.d/infinite: infinite crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# since it is in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

# use full cron commands after a cron modification
# stop the cron service
# sudo stop cron
# start the cron service
# sudo start cron
# verify the cron log
# tail -f /var/log/syslog
# verify the infinite log 
# tail -f /opt/infinite-home/logs/logfile.log
